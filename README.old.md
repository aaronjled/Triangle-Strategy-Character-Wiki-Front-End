Made using React, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, GitHub and hosted on Heroku.

I started off this project wanting to make a wiki that was focused on the main characters and how to unlock them throughout the story. After pursuing the idea further I came up with a few other things I'd like to do with the site later on. I want to allow users to log in and post in a forum about the game, as well as allow for more information about weapons, skills, and abilities that are unlocked. 

Currently users can create, edit, and delete characters.

The next step was to allow users to upload images when creating characters, as well as route to pages based on faction, and create a search function.
